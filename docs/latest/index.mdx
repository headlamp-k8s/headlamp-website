Headlamp is an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes web UI.

Headlamp was created to be a Kubernetes web UI that has the traditional functionality of other
web UIs/dashboards available (i.e. to list and view resources) as well as other features.

Headlamp can be used [in-cluster](./installation/in-cluster), where it's accessed through a web browser,
or as a [desktop application](./installation/desktop) (using the information defined in the user's
kubeconfig).
