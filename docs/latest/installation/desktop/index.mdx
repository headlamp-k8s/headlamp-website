Headlamp can be run as a desktop application, for users who don't want to
deploy it in cluster, or those who want to manage unrelated clusters locally.

Currently there are desktop apps for [Linux](./linux-installation.md), [Mac](./mac-installation.md), and [Windows](./win-installation.md).

Please check the following guides for the installation in your desired platform.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />

## Use a non-default kube config file

If you wish to use a non-default kube config file, then you can do it by
providing it as an argument to Headlamp, e.g.:

```bash
/path/to/headlamp /my/different/kubeconfig
```

or by using an environment variable:

```bash
KUBECONFIG=/my/different/kubeconfig /path/to/headlamp
```

### Use several kube config files

If you need to use more than one kube config file at the same time, you can list
each config file path with a separator.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="unix" label="Unix" default>
    ```bash
    KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig1:kubeconfig2:kubeconfig3 /path/to/headlamp
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell">
    ```powershell
    KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig1;kubeconfig2;kubeconfig3 /path/to/headlamp
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Access using OIDC

OIDC has a feature makes more sense when
[running Headlamp in a cluster](../in-cluster) as it will allow cluster operators to just
give users a URL that they can use for logging in and access Headlamp.
However, if you have your kube config set to use OIDC for the authentication (because you already
authenticated and produced a kube config with that data), Headlamp will read those settings and
try to use them for offering the effortless login to the cluster.

Still, the kube config OIDC settings will not provide a OIDC callback URL, so make sure that your OIDC configuration for your cluster include Headlamp's OIDC callback in its redirect URIs. i.e. say you're using
Dex for the OIDC connection and you have it already configured in your
kube config, then be sure to add the `/oidc-callback` endpoint with Headlamp's the local address
to Dex's `staticClient.redirectURIs`: `http://localhost:6644/oidc-callback`.
