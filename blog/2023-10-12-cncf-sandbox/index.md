Headlamp was recently accepted into the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as a [Sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/headlamp/). We believe it’s an important milestone worth celebrating and sharing with our community. This short post should clarify what this means for the project, the community, and its future.

## Why

Being part of the CNCF Sandbox is a significant step for any project. It provides a neutral home for projects to foster growth and innovation in the cloud-native ecosystem. For Headlamp, this acceptance represents recognition of our commitment to providing a high-quality and extensible Kubernetes UI and our alignment with CNCF’s values and ecosystem.

Headlamp was born out of the need to have a UI for Kubernetes, that was open source, modern, but also flexible and highly customizable. The Headlamp core team has vast experience in open source and working with the community.

As a CNCF Sandbox project, with a clear governance, license, and best practices promoted by the CNCF, Headlamp emphasizes its commitment with the community. We want every user and every company to make Headlamp their own, and contribute back to a base project that represents common goals for anyone needing a Kubernetes UI.

## Looking Ahead

We are incredibly grateful for all the support we’ve received and the opportunity we have to make a difference. As we continue on this journey, we look forward to growing with our community, contributing to the cloud-native ecosystem, and continually improving Headlamp. And we encourage you to join us in achieving this.

Meet us at [KubeCon in Chicago](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/)

As a CNCF project, we will be able to present the project and meet the community at the CNCF Project Pavilion. We’ll be sharing a booth with our friends in the Inspektor Gadget project. Please come by and say Hi! We’d love to talk to you about Headlamp and answer any questions you might have.
