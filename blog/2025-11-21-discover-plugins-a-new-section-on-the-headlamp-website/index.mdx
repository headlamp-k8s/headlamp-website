Plugins have always been a great way to extend Headlamp, but we haven't done enough to showcase them until now. We've added a [dedicated section](/plugins) on the website where you can explore plugins that make Headlamp even more powerful.

<!-- truncate -->

This isn't about launching a new process or creating an official catalog. It's simply a better way to highlight what's already out there and encourage more contributions from the community.

## What You'll Find

The new section shows plugins from the Headlamp team and the community. From UI enhancements to observability tools, these plugins show how flexible Headlamp can be.

Each plugin links to its GitHub repository so you can check out the source, try it, or contribute improvements.

## Have a Plugin to Share?

If you've built a plugin that you think others would find useful, we'd love to hear about it. Reach out to us by opening an issue in the [Headlamp plugins GitHub repo](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/plugins/issues/new), and we'll discuss adding it to the website so more people can discover your work.

## Why This Matters

Headlamp thrives on collaboration. By making plugins more visible, we hope to spark ideas, encourage contributions, and make it easier for developers to build on each other's work.

## Take a Look

Visit the [new plugin section](/plugins) now and see what's possible. If you have an idea for a plugin or one already built, let us know. We'd love to showcase it.
