I'm excited to share that Headlamp will be at [KubeCon NA 2023](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/). ðŸŽ‰

For the first time, we are having a kiosk as well! So, if you're attending the event, you can find us at kiosk P13-A in the [project pavilion](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-engagement/#project-pavilion-hours). Come by and say hi, check out Headlamp's features and demos, and chat with our team members. We'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions on how to make Headlamp even better!

We hope to see you there!
