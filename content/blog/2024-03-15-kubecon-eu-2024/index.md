We're thrilled to announce that Headlamp will be shining bright at [KubeCon EU 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/)! Our team is excited to welcome you to our kiosk, in the project pavillion (all day on Wed. March 20th, and afternoon on Thu. March 21st, kiosk [PP17-B](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/project-engagement/#project-kiosk-directory)), so be sure to pass by. But that's not all â€“ mark your calendars for March 22nd at 14:00, because we're hosting a [Contribufest session](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1Yhez/contribfest-headlamp-k8s-ui-build-your-first-plugin-contribute-with-code-design-or-words?linkback=grid&iframe=no) (workshop) dedicated to Headlamp. This is your chance to join forces with fellow enthusiasts for a collaborative experience of learning, discussion, and coding.

Before the main event, catch us at [Rejekts](https://rejekts.io), the pre-KubeCon event where we'll give a [talk about Headlamp and how it can be a unifying UI for different CNCF tools](https://cfp.cloud-native.rejekts.io/cloud-native-rejekts-eu-paris-2024/talk/D93NPJ/). And speaking of new horizons, we've just recently released [Headlamp version 0.23.0](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/headlamp/releases/tag/v0.23.0)! This update is packed with enhancements that will brighten your workflows.

Going to Kubecon or Rejekts in Paris? Meet us at the talk, the kiosk, or at our workshop and we can give you a sneak peak into our upcoming features that are currently under development.

Hope you liked our news! Join us as we continue to help navigate the Kubernetes ecosystem. See you in Paris!
